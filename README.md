# Peerflix Web
Easily stream torrents to a Raspberry Pi via your smart phone, tablet or pc. Peerflix web provides an interface to stream torrents using peerflix and control playback via omxplayer. For convenience, you can also search torrents directly using peerflix web.

This project is an updated version of [torrentcast](https://github.com/xat/torrentcast), with a web interface to control playback.


**NOTE**: This has only been tested on Raspbian running on a Raspberry Pi 2.

##Setup

**npm Installation**
```sh
$ npm install -g peerflix-web
$ peerflix-web
```
or

**Manual Installation**
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:akinsey/peerflix-web.git
$ cd peerflix-web
$ npm install
$ node server
```

###Server options

You can pass several options when starting the server. You can check what's available through the `node server --help` command. Mostly, it allows you to have subtitles automatically downloaded thanks to [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal).

**Running on startup**

This project can be setup to run from /etc/init.d so it will automatically start up with your Raspberry Pi. Edit the custom configs at the top of the `example.peerflix-web` file and rename and move the script to `/etc/init.d/peerflix-web`. Once in the init.d directory, you can control the server using the following commands:

```sh
$ /etc/init.d/peerflix-web start # add --force to force start
$ /etc/init.d/peerflix-web stop  # add --force to force stop
$ /etc/init.d/peerflix-web status # view current status of running app
```

##Contributions
Currently this project is designed specifically to work with omxplayer running on raspbian, but it can easily be adapted to work with vlc player. I might add support for this in the future, in the meantime I'm open to pull requests for missing features that others think might be useful.

##Requirements
* `node`
* `npm`
* `omxplayer` - default media player for raspbian
* [`subliminal`](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) when using the `--subtitles` option.
